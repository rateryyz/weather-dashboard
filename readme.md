# Weather Dashboard

This project is a **weather dashboard** developed to display current weather information from different cities. It uses the **Weather API** to fetch real-time weather data and shows details such as temperature, weather conditions, and other useful information.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** for the frontend.
- **Weather API** to fetch weather information.
- **Node.js** (if applicable for the backend) to manage dependencies and the server.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, you need to have some tools and configurations set up:

1. **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. If not, you can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Weather API Key**:
   - The project uses the **Weather API** to fetch weather data.
   - To obtain your API key, you need to sign up at the [Weather API website](https://www.weatherapi.com/) and create an account.
   - After creating your account, you will receive a unique API key.

## Setup

### 1. **Clone this repository**

If you haven't already, clone the repository to your computer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
```

### 2. **Install dependencies**

Within the project folder, run the following command to install all the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This command will download and install the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file, including anything in `node_modules/`.

### 3. **Configure the API Key**

You need the **Weather API** key for the dashboard to work correctly. To add the API key to your project:

1. Create a file named `.env` at the root of your project.
2. Inside the `.env` file, add the API key as follows:
   ```
   WEATHER_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```

**Important**: Do not share the API key publicly and never add the `.env` file to your GitHub repository. To ensure the `.env` is ignored by Git, add the following line to your `.gitignore` file:
   ```
   .env
   ```

### 4. **Run the project**

Now that you've set up the API key and installed the dependencies, you can start the local server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will run the project locally, and you can access it in your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or any other configured port).

## Project Structure

The structure of your project will look like this:

```
/your-repository
  /node_modules    # Project dependencies
  /src
    /images        # Images used in the project
    /scripts       # JavaScript files
    /styles        # CSS files
  .gitignore       # File to ignore files like .env
  .env             # Contains the API key
  index.html       # Main HTML file
  package.json     # Contains Node.js dependencies
  README.md        # This file
```
